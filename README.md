# Approximate and Sample Entropy

This repository contains simple MATLAB functions that computes:
- Time Domain: Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Sample Entropy (SpEn)
- Frequency Domain: Shannon (SEshannon), RÃ©nyi (SErenyi)

The algorithm used for ApEn is described on the PhysioNet website (https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/ApEn/).
